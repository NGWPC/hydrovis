summary: Medium-Range NBM 10 Day Peak Flow Arrival Time Forecast
description: "Depicts expected peak flow arrival times derived from the operational
  National Water Model (NWM) medium-range NBM forecast. Shown are reaches that are
  expected to have flow at or above the high water threshold over the next 3 and 10
  days. Reaches are colored by the time at which they are expected to be at their
  maximum flow within the forecast period. High water flows were derived using a 40-year
  retrospective analysis of the NWM (v3.0). \n\nUpdated every 6 hours.\n\nThis service
  is for internal use only for NOAA employees and requires access to view.  Please
  do not share externally without prior approval from OWP as this service is experimental
  and undergoing regular developmental changes. \n\nFor feedback or questions please
  reach out to GID directly via slack at national-water-center-gid or national-water-center-fim
  pages or reach out directly to derek.giardino@noaa.gov"
