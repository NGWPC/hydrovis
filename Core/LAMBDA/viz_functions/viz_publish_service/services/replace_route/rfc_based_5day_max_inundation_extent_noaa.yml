summary: RFC Based 5-Day Maximum Inundation Forecast
description: "Depicts maximum inundation extent over the next 5 days derived from
  the official River Forecast Center (RFC) forecast routed downstream through the
  National Water Model (NWM) stream network. Maximum streamflows are available downstream
  of RFC forecast points whose forecast reaches action status or greater.  \n\nSRC
  Skill: Depicts USGS sites that have an official rating curve, symbolized by the
  \"skill\" of the synthetic rating curve compared to the official USGS rating curve.
  Each point is symbolized by the mean difference in Water Surface Elevation (WSE)
  between the two curves. \n\nEstimated Impacted Buildings: Depicts building footprints
  that intersect inundation extents. The source of the building data is the FEMA USA
  Structures dataset: https://gis-fema.hub.arcgis.com/pages/usa-structures (as of
  August, 2022). Occupancy type data is only available for AL, CA, FL, GA, LA, MS,
  NC, SC, TX, and VA at this time. Also shown are a relative density heatmap of potentially
  impacted buildings (based on extent), county, and HUC level summary layers.\n\n
  Updated every 15 minutes based on RFC Forecast availability\n\nThis service is for
  internal use only for NOAA employees and requires access to view.  Please do not
  share externally without prior approval from OWP as this service is experimental
  and undergoing regular developmental changes. \n\nFor feedback or questions please
