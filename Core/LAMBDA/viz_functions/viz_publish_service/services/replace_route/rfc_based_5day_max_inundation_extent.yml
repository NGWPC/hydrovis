summary: RFC Based 5-Day Maximum Inundation Forecast (EXPERIMENTAL)
description: "*****THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL SERVICE*****\n\nThis experimental map represents
  the National Weather Service's best approximation of inundation extent based upon
  modeled river discharge.\n\nThe map depicts the maximum inundation extent over the
  next 5 days derived from the official River Forecast Center (RFC) forecast routed
  downstream through the National Water Model (NWM) stream network. Forecast inundation
  extents are available for an area that includes 30% of the U.S. population but will
  be expanded later as described in the Story Map below.\n\nhttps://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/c7ae8422207241b5873fff38a22cf66b\n
  \nBoundary of 30% Area: https://maps.water.noaa.gov/server/rest/services/reference/static_public_fim_domain/MapServer\n
  \nShown are sections of river downstream of RFC forecast points whose forecast reaches
  action status or greater as depicted in the following service:\n\nhttps://maps.water.noaa.gov/server/rest/services/rfc/rfc_based_5day_max_streamflow/MapServer\n
  \nHigh water thresholds (regionally varied) and Annual Exceedance Probabilities
  (AEPs) are derived using the 40-year NWM reanalysis simulation which is available
  via the NOAA Open Data Dissemination Program (NODD). \n\nForecast inundation extents
  do not fully capture coastal processes. The service below depicts the boundary of
  this coastal area.\n\nhttps://maps.water.noaa.gov/server/rest/services/reference/static_nwm_coastal_domain_noaa/MapServer\n
