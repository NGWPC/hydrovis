summary: Inundation Extent Analysis (EXPERIMENTAL)
description: "*****THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL SERVICE***** \n\nThis experimental map
  represents the National Weather Service's best approximation of inundation extent
  based upon modeled river discharge. The map depicts the inundation extent of the
  National Water Model (NWM) streamflow forecast where the NWM is signaling high water.
  This service is derived from the analysis and assimilation configuration of the
  NWM for an area that includes 30% of the U.S. population but will be expanded later
  as described in the Story Map below. https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/c7ae8422207241b5873fff38a22cf66b\n
  \nHigh water thresholds (regionally varied) and Annual Exceedance Probabilities
  (AEPs) are derived using the 40-year NWM reanalysis simulation which is available
  via the NOAA Open Data Dissemination Program (NODD). Forecast inundation extents
  do not fully capture coastal processes. The service below depicts the boundary of
  this coastal area. \n\nUpdated hourly.\n\nShown are sections of river with flow
  at or above a predetermined high water threshold as depicted in the following service:\n
