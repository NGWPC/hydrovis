summary: Past 14-Day High Flow Magnitude Analysis
description: "Depicts the magnitude of the peak NWM streamflow analysis over the past
  14 days where the National Water Model (NWM) signaled high water. This service is
  derived from the analysis and assimilation configuration of the NWM over the contiguous
  U.S. Shown are reaches with flow at or above high water thresholds. Reaches are
  colored by the annual exceedance probability (AEP) of their maximum flow over the
  past 14 days. High water thresholds (regionally varied) and AEPs were derived using
  the 40-year NWM v3.0 reanalysis simulation.\n\nUpdated daily.\n\nLink to graphical
