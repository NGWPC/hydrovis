summary: Inundation Extent Analysis - Alaska (EXPERIMENTAL)
description: '
<br><br>
*****THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL SERVICE*****
<br><br>
This experimental map represents the National Weather Service''s best approximation of inundation extent based upon modeled river discharge.
<br><br>
The map depicts the inundation extent of the National Water Model (NWM) streamflow forecast for Alaska where the NWM is signaling high water. 
<br><br>
Shown are sections of river with flow at or above a predetermined high water threshold as depicted in the following service:
<br><br>
<a>https://maps.water.noaa.gov/server/rest/services/nwm/ana_high_flow_magnitude_ak/MapServer</a>
<br><br>
High water thresholds (regionally varied) and Annual Exceedance Probabilities (AEPs) are derived using the 40-year NWM reanalysis simulation which is available via the NOAA Open Data Dissemination Program (NODD). Forecast inundation extents do not fully capture coastal processes. 
<br><br>
This service is updated hourly.
