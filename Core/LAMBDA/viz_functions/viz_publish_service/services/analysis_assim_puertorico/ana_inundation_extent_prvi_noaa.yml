summary: Inundation Extent Analysis for Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands
description: "Depicts the inundation extent of the National Water Model (NWM) streamflow
  forecast where the NWM is signaling high water. This service is derived from the
  analysis and assimilation configuration of the NWM over Puerto Rico and the U.S.
  Virgin Islands. Shown are reaches with flow at or above high water thresholds. High
  water thresholds and AEPs were derived from USGS regression equations found at https://pubs.usgs.gov/wri/wri994142/pdf/wri99-4142.pdf.\
  \  \n\nEstimated Impacted Buildings: Depicts building footprints that intersect
  inundation extents. The source of the building data is the FEMA USA Structures dataset:
  https://gis-fema.hub.arcgis.com/pages/usa-structures (as of August, 2022). Occupancy
  type data is only available for AL, CA, FL, GA, LA, MS, NC, SC, TX, and VA at this
  time. Also shown are a relative density heatmap of potentially impacted buildings
  (based on extent), and county level summary layers.\n\nUpdated hourly.\n\nThis service
  is for internal use only for NOAA employees and requires access to view.  Please
  do not share externally without prior approval from OWP as this service is experimental
  and undergoing regular developmental changes. \n\nFor feedback or questions please
  reach out to GID directly via slack at national-water-center-gid or national-water-center-fim
  pages or reach out directly to derek.giardino@noaa.gov"
