summary: High Flow Magnitude Analysis for Puerto Rico and Virgin Islands
description: "Depicts the magnitude of the National Water Model (NWM) streamflow forecast
  where the NWM is signaling high water. This service is derived from the analysis
  and assimilation configuration of the NWM over Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.
  Shown are reaches with flow at or above high water thresholds. Reaches are colored
  by the annual exceedance probability (AEP) of their current flow. High water thresholds
  and AEPs were derived from USGS regression equations found at https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2010/5035/sir2010-5035_text.pdf.
