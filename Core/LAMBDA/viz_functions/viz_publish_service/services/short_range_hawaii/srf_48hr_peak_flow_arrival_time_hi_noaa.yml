summary: Short-Range 48 Hour Peak Flow Arrival Time Forecast for Hawaii
description: "Depicts expected peak flow arrival times derived from the operational
  National Water Model (NWM) short-range forecast for the state of Hawaii. Shown are
  reaches that are expected to have flow at or above high water threshold flow over
  the next 48 hours. Reaches are colored by the time at which they are expected to
  be at their maximum flow within the forecast period. High water threshold flows
  and annual exceedance probabilities were derived from USGS regression equations
  found at https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2010/5035/sir2010-5035_text.pdf.\n\nUpdated every
  12 hours.\n\nThis service is for internal use only for NOAA employees and requires
  access to view.  Please do not share externally without prior approval from OWP
  as this service is experimental and undergoing regular developmental changes. \n
