summary: Short-Range 48 Hour Rapid Onset Flooding Forecast for Hawaii
description: "Depicts forecast rapid onset flooding using the short-range configuration
  of the National Water Model (NWM) for the state of Hawaii. Shown are reaches (stream
  order 4 and below) with a forecast flow increase of 100% or greater within an hour,
  and which are expected to be at or above the high water threshold within 6 hours
  of that increase. Also shown are USGS HUC10 polygons symbolized by the percentage
  of NWM waterway length (within each HUC10) that is expected to meet the previously
  mentioned criteria. High water threshold flows and annual exceedance probabilities
  were derived from USGS regression equations found at https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2010/5035/sir2010-5035_text.pdf.
