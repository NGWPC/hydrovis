summary: Inundation Extent Analysis for Hawaii
description: "Depicts the inundation extent of the National Water Model (NWM) streamflow
  forecast where the NWM is signaling high water. This service is derived from the
  analysis and assimilation configuration of the NWM over Hawaii. Shown are reaches
  with flow at or above high water thresholds. High water thresholds and AEPs were
  derived from USGS regression equations found at https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2010/5035/sir2010-5035_text.pdf.
  \n\nEstimated Impacted Buildings: Depicts building footprints that intersect inundation
  extents. The source of the building data is the FEMA USA Structures dataset: https://gis-fema.hub.arcgis.com/pages/usa-structures
  (as of August, 2022). Occupancy type data is only available for AL, CA, FL, GA,
  LA, MS, NC, SC, TX, and VA at this time. Also shown are a relative density heatmap
  of potentially impacted buildings (based on extent), and county level summary layers.\n
  \nUpdated hourly.\n\nThis service is for internal use only for NOAA employees and
  requires access to view.  Please do not share externally without prior approval
  from OWP as this service is experimental and undergoing regular developmental changes.
  \n\nFor feedback or questions please reach out to GID directly via slack at national-water-center-gid
  or national-water-center-fim pages or reach out directly to derek.giardino@noaa.gov"
