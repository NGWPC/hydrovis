summary: Short-Range 18 Hour High Water Arrival Time Forecast
description: "Depicts the forecast arrival time of high water over the next 18 hours.
  This service is derived from the short-range configuration of the National Water
  Model (NWM) over the contiguous U.S. Shown are reaches that are expected to have
  flow at or above the high water threshold over the next 18 hours. Reaches are colored
  by the time at which they are forecast to reach high water. High water thresholds
  (regionally varied) were derived using the 40-year NWM v3.0 reanalysis simulation\n
  \nUpdated hourly.\n\nThis service is for internal use only for NOAA employees and
  requires access to view.  Please do not share externally without prior approval
  from OWP as this service is experimental and undergoing regular developmental changes.
  \n\nFor feedback or questions please reach out to GID directly via slack at national-water-center-gid
  or national-water-center-fim pages or reach out directly to derek.giardino@noaa.gov"
