summary: Short-Range Water Management Forecast
description: "Depicts the source of reservoir forecasts from output of the operational
  National Water Model (NWM) short-range forecast. Reservoirs can have forecasts obtained
  from 1 of 4 sources: Level Pool, RFC Forecast, USACE-Persistence, or USGS-Persistence.
  Reservoirs that have RFC, USACE, or USGS forecasts use those in the NWM when available;
  otherwise, the NWM will default to using the Level Pool method.\n\nUpdated hourly.\n
