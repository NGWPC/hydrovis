summary: Short-Range 18 Hour Maximum High Flow Magnitude Forecast
description: "Depicts the magnitude of the peak National Water Model (NWM) streamflow
  forecast over the next 18 hours where the NWM is signaling high water. This service
  is derived from the short-range configuration of the NWM over the contiguous U.S.
  Shown are reaches with peak flow at or above high water thresholds. Reaches are
  colored by the annual exceedance probability (AEP) of their forecast peak flow.
  High water thresholds (regionally varied) and AEPs were derived using the 40-year
  NWM v3.0 reanalysis simulation.\n\nUpdated hourly.\n\nLink to graphical web page:
