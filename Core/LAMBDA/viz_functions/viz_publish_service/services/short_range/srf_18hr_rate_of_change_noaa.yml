summary: Short-Range 18 Hour Rate of Change Forecast
description: "Depicts expected change in discharge derived from the operational National
  Water Model (NWM) short-range forecast. Change is computed between the current streamflow
  and that expected over the next 18 hours at 3-hour intervals, and is only displayed
  for reaches that are expected to have flow at or above their high water threshold.
  High water thresholds (regionally varied) and AEPs were derived using the 40-year
  NWM v3.0 reanalysis simulation\n\nUpdated hourly.\n\nThis service is for internal
  use only for NOAA employees and requires access to view.  Please do not share externally
  without prior approval from OWP as this service is experimental and undergoing regular
  developmental changes. \n\nFor feedback or questions please reach out to GID directly
  via slack at national-water-center-gid or national-water-center-fim pages or reach
  out directly to derek.giardino@noaa.gov"
