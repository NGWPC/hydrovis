summary: Depicts flood inundation extents derived from NWM high water threshold, annual
  exceedance probabilities and the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) technique.
description: "Depicts the inundation extent of the National Water Model (NWM) high
  water threshold and annual exceedance probabilities. High water threshold flows
  and annual exceedance probabilities were derived from USGS regression equations
  found at https://pubs.usgs.gov/wri/wri994142/pdf/wri99-4142.pdf.  High water thresholds
  (regionally varied) and AEPs were derived using the 40-year NWM v3.0 reanalysis
  simulation. \n\nThis is a static service and not a forecast service\n\nThis service
  is for internal use only for NOAA employees and requires access to view.  Please
  do not share externally without prior approval from OWP as this service is experimental
  and undergoing regular developmental changes. \n\nFor feedback or questions please
  reach out to GID directly via slack at national-water-center-gid or national-water-center-fim
  pages or reach out directly to derek.giardino@noaa.gov"
