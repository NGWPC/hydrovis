summary: Depicts flood inundation extents derived from official NWS category thresholds
  and the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) technique. Official threshold discharges
  are used.
description: "Depicts flood inundation extents derived from official NWS category
  thresholds and the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) technique. Official threshold
  discharges are used for Action, Minor, Moderate, Major, and Record. Not all threshold
  values are available for all sites. \n\nThe threshold is the lowest value in the
  range of values for a flood category. For example, if \\\"Action\\\" begins at 915.3
  CFS (10 Feet) and ends at 1120.5 CFS (12 Feet), then 915.3 CFS (10 Feet) will be
  the utilized discharge value in mapping. \n\nFlood inundation maps are colored according
  to their category. Mapping extends 5 miles upstream and downstream of AHPS gage
  locations for streams of consistent stream order. \n\nThis is a static service and
  not a forecast service.\n\nThis service is for internal use only for NOAA employees
  and requires access to view.  Please do not share externally without prior approval
  from OWP as this service is experimental and undergoing regular developmental changes.
  \n\nFor feedback or questions please reach out to GID directly via slack at national-water-center-gid
  or national-water-center-fim pages or reach out directly to derek.giardino@noaa.gov"
