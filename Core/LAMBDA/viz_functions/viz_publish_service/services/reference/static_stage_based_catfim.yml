summary: Static Stage-Based CatFIM (EXPERIMENTAL)
description: "*****THIS IS AN EXPERIMENTAL SERVICE*****\n\nThis experimental map represents
  the National Weather Service's best approximation of inundation extent based upon
  modeled river discharge.\n\nThe map depicts the inundation extent of official NWS
  categorigal stage thresholds for an area that includes 30% of the U.S. population
  but will be expanded later as described in the Story Map below.\n\nhttps://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/c7ae8422207241b5873fff38a22cf66b\n
  \nBoundary of 30% Area: https://maps.water.noaa.gov/server/rest/services/reference/static_public_fim_domain/MapServer\n
  \nDepicts flood inundation extents derived from official NWS category thresholds
  and for every foot in between using the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) technique.
  Official stage thresholds (converted to water surface elevation) are used. Flood
  inundation maps are colored according to their category.  Mapping is produced for
  up to 5 feet above major flood stage.  \n\nRecord flooding is its own layer since
  it could be below major flooding category. \n\nMapping extends 5 miles upstream
  and downstream of AHPS gage locations for streams of consistent stream order, as
  well as calibrated to the USGS rating at the gage. Not all sites are mapped due
  to incomplete or unacceptable gage characteristics such as altitute accuracy, datum
  method, etc. (this information is available in the attributes table for the \"sites\"\
  \ layer. \n\nThis service is static and only updated when a new FIM version is released.\n
