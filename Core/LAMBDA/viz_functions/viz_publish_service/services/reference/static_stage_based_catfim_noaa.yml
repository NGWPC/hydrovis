summary: Depicts flood inundation extents derived from official NWS category thresholds
  and the Height Above Nearest Drainage (HAND) technique. Official stage thresholds
  are used.
description: "Depicts flood inundation extents derived from official NWS category
  thresholds and for every foot in between using the Height Above Nearest Drainage
  (HAND) technique. Official stage thresholds (converted to water surface elevation)
  are used. Flood inundation maps are colored according to their category.  Mapping
  is produced for up to 5 feet above major flood stage.  \n\nRecord flooding is its
  own layer since it could be below major flooding category. \n\nMapping extends 5
  miles upstream and downstream of AHPS gage locations for streams of consistent stream
  order, as well as calibrated to the USGS rating at the gage. Not all sites are mapped
  due to incomplete or unacceptable gage characteristics such as altitute accuracy,
  datum method, etc. (this information is available in the attributes table for the
  \"sites\" layer. \n\nThis is a static service and not a forecast service.\n\nThis
  service is for internal use only for NOAA employees and requires access to view.\
  \  Please do not share externally without prior approval from OWP as this service
  is experimental and undergoing regular developmental changes. \n\nFor feedback or
  questions please reach out to GID directly via slack at national-water-center-gid
  or national-water-center-fim pages or reach out directly to derek.giardino@noaa.gov"
