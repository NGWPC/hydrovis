summary: Medium-Range GFS 10 Day Rapid Onset Flooding Forecast
description: "Depicts forecast rapid onset flooding using the medium-range GFS configuration
  of the National Water Model (NWM) over the contiguous U.S. Shown are reaches (stream
  order 4 and below) with a forecast flow increase of 100% or greater within 3 hours,
  and which are expected to be at or above the high water threshold within 6 hours
  of that increase (all calculated in 3 hour increments). Also shown are USGS HUC08
  polygons symbolized by the percentage of NWM waterway length (within each HUC08)
  that is expected to meet the previously mentioned criteria. High water thresholds
  (regionally varied) were derived using the 40-year NWM v3.0 reanalysis simulation.
