summary: Medium-Range GFS 10 Day Water Management Forecast
description: "Depicts the source of reservoir forecasts from outputs of the operational
  National Water Model (NWM) medium-range forecast. Reservoirs can have forecasts
  obtained from 1 of 4 sources: Level Pool, RFC Forecast, USACE-Persistence, or USGS-Persistence.
  Reservoirs that have RFC, USACE, or USGS forecasts use those in the NWM when available;
  otherwise, the NWM will default to using the Level Pool method.\n\nUpdated every
  6 hours.\n\nThis service is for internal use only for NOAA employees and requires
  access to view.  Please do not share externally without prior approval from OWP
  as this service is experimental and undergoing regular developmental changes. \n
  \nFor feedback or questions please reach out to GID directly via slack at national-water-center-gid
  or national-water-center-fim pages or reach out directly to derek.giardino@noaa.gov"
