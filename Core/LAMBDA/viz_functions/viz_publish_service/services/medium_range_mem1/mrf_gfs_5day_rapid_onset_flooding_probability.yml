summary: Medium-Range GFS 5 Day Rapid Onset Flooding Probability Forecast
description: "Depicts the probability of forecast rapid onset flooding over the next
  10 days using ensembles from the medium-range GFS configuration of the National
  Water Model (NWM) over the contiguous U.S. Shown are reaches that are expected to
  have flow at or above high water thresholds on Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, Days 4-5, and
  Days 1-5 using the 6 time-lagged ensemble members of the medium-range forecast.
  Reaches are colored by the probability that they will meet or exceed rapid onset
  conditions on Day 1, Day 2, Day 3, Days 4-5, and Days 1-5. Probabilities are computed
  as the % agreement across the 6 time-lagged ensemble members, equally weighted.
  Hotspots show average 1-5 day rapid onset flooding probability, weighted by reach
  length, for USGS HUC8 basins with greater than 10% of NWM feature length meeting
  rapid onset criteria in the next 5 days. High water thresholds (regionally varied)
  were derived using the 40-year NWM v3.0 reanalysis simulation.\n\nUpdated every
  6 hours for forecast.\n\nLink to graphical web page: https://www.weather.gov/owp/operations\n
