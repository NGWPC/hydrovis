summary: Medium-Range GFS 10 Day High Water Arrival Time Forecast
description: "Depicts the forecast arrival time of high water over the next 10 days.
  This service is derived from the medium-range GFS configuration of the National
  Water Model (NWM) over the contiguous U.S. Shown are reaches that are expected to
  have flow at or above the high water threshold over the next 10 days. Reaches are
  colored by the time at which they are forecast to reach high water (calculated in
  3 hour increments). High water thresholds (regionally varied) were derived using
  the 40-year NWM v3.0 reanalysis simulation. \n\nUpdated every 6 hours.\n\nLink to
