summary: Medium-Range GFS 10 Day Peak Flow Arrival Time Forecast
description: "Depicts expected peak flow arrival times derived from the operational
  National Water Model (NWM) medium-range GFS forecast. Shown are reaches that are
  expected to have flow at or above the high water threshold over the next 3 and 10
  days. Reaches are colored by the time at which they are expected to be at their
  maximum flow within the forecast period. High water flows were derived using a 40-year
  retrospective analysis of the NWM v3.0 reanalysis simulation. \n\nUpdated every
  6 hours.\n\nLink to graphical web page: https://www.weather.gov/owp/operations\n
