summary: Medium-Range GFS 10 Day Maximum Inundation Extent Forecast
description: "Depicts the inundation extent of the peak National Water Model (NWM)
  streamflow forecast over the next 3, 5, and 10 days where the NWM is signaling high
  water. This service is derived from the medium-range GFS configuration of the NWM
  over the contiguous U.S. Shown are reaches with peak flow at or above high water
  thresholds. High water thresholds (regionally varied) and AEPs were derived using
  the 40-year NWM v3.0 reanalysis simulation. \n\nSRC Skill: Depicts USGS sites that
  have an official rating curve, symbolized by the \"skill\" of the synthetic rating
  curve compared to the official USGS rating curve. Each point is symbolized by the
  mean difference in Water Surface Elevation (WSE) between the two curves. \n\nEstimated
  Impacted Buildings: Depicts building footprints that intersect inundation extents.
  The source of the building data is the FEMA USA Structures dataset: https://gis-fema.hub.arcgis.com/pages/usa-structures
  (as of August, 2022). Occupancy type data is only available for AL, CA, FL, GA,
  LA, MS, NC, SC, TX, and VA at this time. Also shown are a relative density heatmap
  of potentially impacted buildings (based on extent), county, and HUC level summary
  layers. \n\nUpdated every 6 hours.\n\nEstimated Impacted Critical Infrastructure: Depicts colleges, 
  fire stations, hospitals, nursing homes, police stations, and schools
  that intersect inundation extents. The critical infrastructure data is derived
  from the static FEMA Infrastructure dataset.\n\nThis service is for internal use only for
  NOAA employees and requires access to view.  Please do not share externally without
  prior approval from OWP as this service is experimental and undergoing regular developmental
  changes. \n\nFor feedback or questions please reach out to GID directly via slack
  at national-water-center-gid or national-water-center-fim pages or reach out directly
  to derek.giardino@noaa.gov"
