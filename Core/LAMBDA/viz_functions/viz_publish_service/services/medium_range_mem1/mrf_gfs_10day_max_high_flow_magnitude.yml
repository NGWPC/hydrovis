summary: Medium-Range GFS 10 Day Maximum High Flow Magnitude Forecast
description: "Depicts the magnitude of the peak National Water Model (NWM) streamflow
  forecast over the next 3, 5 and 10 days where the NWM is signaling high water. This
  service is derived from the medium-range GFS configuration of the NWM over the contiguous
  U.S. Shown are reaches with peak flow at or above high water thresholds. Reaches
  are colored by the annual exceedance probability (AEP) of their forecast peak flow.
  High water thresholds (regionally varied) and AEPs were derived using the 40-year
  NWM v3.0 reanalysis simulation. \n\nUpdated every 6 hours.\n\nLink to graphical
